# Human Benchmark Bot (Linux)

A Python-based automation bot for the [Human Benchmark](https://www.humanbenchmark.com) tests, designed to run on **Linux** using Selenium.  
This bot currently supports:

- **Number Memory**
- **Typing**
- **Verbal Memory**
- **Aim Trainer**
- **Reaction Time**
- **Sequence Memory** – limited automation
- **Chimp Test** – requires image recognition for full automation

**Note:** Some tests are not working yet. I will implement/fix them as soon as possible.
